
1. ✓ Video and NPY frames are PERFECTLY synchronized (100% match)
   → No problem with NPY files - they exactly match their source videos

2. GT CSV Issues:
   - Some GT files have +1 or +2 MORE frames than videos
   - Some GT files have -1 to -88 LESS frames than videos
   - S1 acting3: Videos themselves vary (2679-2769 frames) but GT is constant (2770)   
   - S2 acting1 cam6: Video has only 2421 frames while others have 3386

3. Recommendation:
   - You need to TRIM GT CSV files to match video frame counts
   - For activities where GT > Video: Remove last N rows from GT CSV
   - For activities where GT < Video: This suggests video recording continued after GT stopped
     → Consider trimming videos OR extrapolating GT data
