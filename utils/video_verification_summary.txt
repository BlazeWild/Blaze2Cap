VIDEO FRAME VERIFICATION SUMMARY
Checked: S1/acting1, S1/acting3, S2/acting1
================================================================================

KEY FINDING: Blazepose extraction is CORRECT! 
The issue is with the CSV ground truth files.

================================================================================
S1 / acting1
================================================================================
Status: ✓ PERFECT - Everything matches!

Video Frames: 4115 (all 8 cameras)
NPY Frames:   4115 (all 8 cameras)
CSV Rows:     4115

Result: Video = NPY = CSV → NO CHANGES NEEDED


================================================================================
S1 / acting3
================================================================================
Status: ✗ CSV GROUND TRUTH IS WRONG

Video Frames: 2682, 2679, 2679, 2679, 2682, 2682, 2769, 2681 (cams 1-8)
NPY Frames:   2682, 2679, 2679, 2679, 2682, 2682, 2769, 2681 (cams 1-8)
CSV Rows:     2770 (INCORRECT - 88-91 extra rows)

Result: Video = NPY ✓ | CSV is WRONG ✗
Action: CSV ground truth needs correction, NOT blazepose re-extraction
        CSV has 88-91 MORE rows than actual video frames


================================================================================
S2 / acting1
================================================================================
Status: ✗ CSV GROUND TRUTH IS WRONG

Video Frames: 3386, 3386, 3386, 3386, 3386, 2421, 3386, 3386 (cams 1-8)
NPY Frames:   3386, 3386, 3386, 3386, 3386, 2421, 3386, 3386 (cams 1-8)
CSV Rows:     3387 (INCORRECT - 1 extra row for most cams, 966 extra for cam6)

Result: Video = NPY ✓ | CSV is WRONG ✗
Action: CSV ground truth needs correction, NOT blazepose re-extraction
        - Most cameras: CSV has 1 MORE row than video
        - cam6: CSV has 966 MORE rows than video (major discrepancy)


================================================================================
CONCLUSION
================================================================================

✓ Blazepose NPY arrays perfectly match actual video frame counts
✗ CSV ground truth files have incorrect frame counts

RECOMMENDATION:
1. DO NOT re-extract blazepose - the current NPY files are CORRECT
2. The CSV ground truth files need to be corrected/re-synced
3. For training, use the NPY frame counts as the ground truth
4. Investigate why CSV files have extra rows (possible sync issues)

CAMERA-SPECIFIC ISSUES:
- S2/acting1/cam6: Video only has 2421 frames while other cams have 3386
  This appears to be a video capture issue, not extraction issue

NEXT STEPS:
- Verify other activities similarly (check if CSV or video is the source of truth)
- If CSV should be authoritative, then videos might be corrupted/incomplete
- If videos are authoritative, then CSV files need frame count correction
